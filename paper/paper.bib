   abstract = {Background: We used RNA sequencing to analyze transcript profiles of ten autopsy brain regions from ten subjects. RNA sequencing techniques were designed to detect both coding and non-coding RNA, splice isoform composition, and allelic expression. Brain regions were selected from five subjects with a documented history of smoking and five non-smokers. Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on SOLiD instruments to a depth of >40 million reads, using linearly amplified, ribosomally depleted RNA. Sequencing libraries were prepared with both poly-dT and random hexamer primers to detect all RNA classes, including long non-coding (lncRNA), intronic and intergenic transcripts, and transcripts lacking poly-A tails, providing additional data not previously available. The study was designed to generate a database of the complete transcriptomes in brain region for gene network analyses and discovery of regulatory variants. Results: Of 20,318 protein coding and 18,080 lncRNA genes annotated from GENCODE and lncipedia, 12 thousand protein coding and 2 thousand lncRNA transcripts were detectable at a conservative threshold. Of the aligned reads, 52 % were exonic, 34 % intronic and 14 % intergenic. A majority of protein coding genes (65 %) was expressed in all regions, whereas ncRNAs displayed a more restricted distribution. Profiles of RNA isoforms varied across brain regions and subjects at multiple gene loci, with neurexin 3 (NRXN3) a prominent example. Allelic RNA ratios deviating from unity were identified in > 400 genes, detectable in both protein-coding and non-coding genes, indicating the presence of cis-acting regulatory variants. Mathematical modeling was used to identify RNAs stably expressed in all brain regions (serving as potential markers for normalizing expression levels), linked to basic cellular functions. An initial analysis of differential expression analysis between smokers and nonsmokers implicated a number of genes, several previously associated with nicotine exposure. Conclusions: RNA sequencing identifies distinct and consistent differences in gene expression between brain regions, with non-coding RNA displaying greater diversity between brain regions than mRNAs. Numerous RNAs exhibit robust allele selective expression, proving a means for discovery of cis-acting regulatory factors with potential clinical relevance.},

RNA sequencing of single cells allowed us to appreciate the diversity of cell types in the human brain in an unprecedented manner and its power to reveal cell-type specific changes in cell populations has just begun to be explored. In this context, looking at the proteome of single cells promises to bring functional information and contribute to completing the picture. The potential of single cell proteome, in developing a better understanding of the intricate connections between the very diverse cell populations in the brain, is huge. Whereas early approaches to address single-cell proteome have identified hundreds of proteins, today, techniques combining isobaric labelling and LC-MS can lead to the identification of thousands of proteins. In this review, we describe methods which have been used to identify and quantify proteins from single cells and propose that the application of isobaric labeling and label-free quantitative proteomics approach for single-cell analysis is ready to provide useful information for the neurobiology field.},

Although high-throughput methods are available for mapping brain-wide activity and transcriptomes, comparable methods for mapping region-to-region connectivity remain slow and expensive because they require averaging across hundreds of brains. Here we describe BRICseq (brain-wide individual animal connectome sequencing), which leverages DNA barcoding and sequencing to map connectivity from single individuals in a few weeks and at low cost. Applying BRICseq to the mouse neocortex, we find that region-to-region connectivity provides a simple bridge relating transcriptome to activity: the spatial expression patterns of a few genes predict region-to-region connectivity, and connectivity predicts activity correlations. We also exploited BRICseq to map the mutant BTBR mouse brain, which lacks a corpus callosum, and recapitulated its known connectopathies. BRICseq allows individual laboratories to compare how age, sex, environment, genetics, and species affect neuronal wiring and to integrate these with functional activity and gene expression.},

   abstract = {Neurons transmit information to distant brain regions via long-range axonal projections. In the mouse, area-to-area connections have only been systematically mapped using bulk labeling techniques, which obscure the diverse projections of intermingled single neurons. Here we describe MAPseq (Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing), a technique that can map the projections of thousands or even millions of single neurons by labeling large sets of neurons with random RNA sequences (“barcodes”). Axons are filled with barcode mRNA, each putative projection area is dissected, and the barcode mRNA is extracted and sequenced. Applying MAPseq to the locus coeruleus (LC), we find that individual LC neurons have preferred cortical targets. By recasting neuroanatomy, which is traditionally viewed as a problem of microscopy, as a problem of sequencing, MAPseq harnesses advances in sequencing technology to permit high-throughput interrogation of brain circuits.},

Resolving these cell types requires both single-neuron resolution and high throughput, a challenging combination with conventional methods. Here, we introduce barcoded anatomy resolved by sequencing (BARseq), a multiplexed method based on RNA barcoding for mapping projections of thousands of spatially resolved neurons in a single brain and relating those projections to other properties such as gene or Cre expression. Mapping the projections to 11 areas of 3,579 neurons in mouse auditory cortex using BARseq confirmed the laminar organization of the three top classes (intratelencephalic [IT], pyramidal tract-like [PT-like], and corticothalamic [CT]) of projection neurons. In depth analysis uncovered a projection type restricted almost exclusively to transcriptionally defined subtypes of IT neurons. By bridging anatomical and transcriptomic approaches at cellular resolution with high throughput, BARseq can potentially uncover the organizing principles underlying the structure and formation of neural circuits.},

   abstract = {Modern high throughput brain wide profiling techniques for cells and their morphology, connectivity, and other properties, make the use of reference atlases with 3D coordinate frameworks essential. However, anatomical location of observations made in microscopic sectional images from rodent brains is typically determined by comparison with 2D anatomical reference atlases. A major challenge in this regard is that microscopic sections often are cut with orientations deviating from the standard planes used in the reference atlases, resulting in inaccuracies and a need for tedious correction steps. Overall, efficient tools for registration of large series of section images to reference atlases are currently not widely available. Here we present QuickNII, a stand-alone software tool for semi-automated affine spatial registration of sectional image data to a 3D reference atlas coordinate framework. A key feature in the tool is the capability to generate user defined cut planes through the reference atlas, matching the orientation of the cut plane of the sectional image data. The reference atlas is transformed to match anatomical landmarks in the corresponding experimental images. In this way, the spatial relationship between experimental image and atlas is defined, without introducing distortions in the original experimental images. Following anchoring of a limited number of sections containing key landmarks, transformations are propagated across the entire series of sectional images to reduce the amount of manual steps required. By having coordinates assigned to the experimental images, further analysis of the distribution of features extracted from the images is greatly facilitated.},

However, comparing spatial observations across sections, samples, and technologies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we develop STalign to align ST datasets in a manner that accounts for partially matched tissue sections and other local non-linear distortions using diffeomorphic metric mapping. We apply STalign to align ST datasets within and across technologies as well as to align ST datasets to a 3D common coordinate framework. We show that STalign achieves high gene expression and cell-type correspondence across matched spatial locations that is significantly improved over landmark-based affine alignments. Applying STalign to align ST datasets of the mouse brain to the 3D common coordinate framework from the Allen Brain Atlas, we highlight how STalign can be used to lift over brain region annotations and enable the interrogation of compositional heterogeneity across anatomical structures.

   abstract = {Motivation: Modern anatomical and developmental studies often require high-resolution imaging of large specimens in three dimensions (3D). Confocal microscopy produces high-resolution 3D images, but is limited by a relatively small field of view compared with the size of large biological specimens. Therefore, motorized stages that move the sample are used to create a tiled scan of the whole specimen. The physical coordinates provided by the microscope stage are not precise enough to allow direct reconstruction (Stitching) of the whole image from individual image stacks. Results: To optimally stitch a large collection of 3D confocal images, we developed a method that, based on the Fourier Shift Theorem, computes all possible translations between pairs of 3D images, yielding the best overlap in terms of the cross-correlation measure and subsequently finds the globally optimal configuration of the whole group of 3D images. This method avoids the propagation of errors by consecutive registration steps. Additionally, to compensate the brightness differences between tiles, we apply a smooth, non-linear intensity transition between the overlapping images. Our stitching approach is fast, works on 2D and 3D images, and for small image sets does not require prior knowledge about the tile configuration. © The Author 2009.

Here we introduce POINTseq (projections of interest by sequencing), a high-throughput and user-friendly barcoded connectomics method that uses cell type specific barcoding and sequencing to rapidly map single-cell projections of a cell type of interest for thousands of neurons per animal. POINTseq leverages pseudotyping of Sindbis virus and a specific alphavirus-cellular receptor pair to make Sindbis infections cell type specific. It thus integrates MAPseq-style high-throughput barcoded projection mapping with the established viral-genetic neural circuit analysis toolbox. We validated POINTseq by mapping genetically and projection-defined cell populations in the mouse motor cortex. We then applied POINTseq to midbrain dopaminergic neurons and reconstructed the brain-wide single-cell projections of 3,813 dopaminergic neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). We define over 30 connectomic cell types, vastly exceeding the known diversity of dopaminergic cell types, and identify stereotyped projection motifs that may mediate parallel dopamine signaling. This data constitutes the anatomical substrate on which the diverse functions of dopamine in the brain are built.
