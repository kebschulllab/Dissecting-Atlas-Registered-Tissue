ARRIVE 2.0 – Essential 10 (Author Checklist)
Ethics
------
Institutional oversight: Johns Hopkins University ACUC
Protocols: MO20M376; MO23M346

1) Study design
   Purpose was to generate an example image to validate and demonstrate the software. No hypothesis testing or treatment groups. 

2) Sample size
   2 mice

3) Inclusion/exclusion criteria
   Animals were included if they met facility health standards and were scheduled on approved protocols. 
   Sections were included if they met LMD image-quality criteria (no tearing/folding, adequate contrast, correct plane). 

4) Randomization
   Not applicable—no allocation to treatment/control. 

5) Blinding
   Not applicable—no group comparisons. 

6) Outcome measures
   Primary outcome for the sample asset: an image suitable for testing installation and basic functions of the software 
   (readability, image I/O, ROI tools). Quality metrics used to qualify the image included focus sharpness and 
   signal-to-background appropriate for LMD context; no biological endpoints were analyzed from the distributed example.

7) Statistical methods
   None—no inferential statistics performed. 

8) Experimental animals
   Species/strain: Mus musculus, C57BL/6J; Sex: both sexes maintained on protocol; Age: adult (~8–12 weeks) at time 
   of tissue collection; Health status: standard SPF barrier facility. Animals maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with 
   ad libitum food and water.

9) Experimental procedures
   Tissue preparation for LMD followed established methods under institutional SOPs: euthanasia per ACUC-approved methods, 
   rapid brain extraction, fresh-frozen embedding, cryosectioning, and slide prep appropriate for LMD; sections were imaged 
   to generate the example file. Detailed LMD prep steps are provided in Huang, L. et al. BRICseq Bridges Brain-wide 
   Interregional Connectivity to Neural Activity and Gene Expression in Single Animals. Cell 182, 177–188.e27 (2020).

10) Results
    This is a demonstrative software asset rather than a hypothesis-driven experiment; results are limited to confirming that 
    the example image loads and exercises core features of the software.
